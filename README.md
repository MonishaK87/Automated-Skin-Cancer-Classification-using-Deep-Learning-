# Automated-Skin-Cancer-Classification-using-Deep-Learning-
This project aims to detect and classify skin cancer from dermoscopic images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By leveraging deep learning and image processing techniques, the system achieves high accuracy in identifying cancerous skin lesions, supporting early diagnosis and treatment.
# Key Features
* Deep Learning Model: Uses CNN architecture for high-accuracy image classification.
* Image Processing: Pre-processes dermoscopic images using OpenCV to enhance image quality and remove noise.
* High Accuracy: Achieves a classification accuracy of 90% using a well-curated dataset.
* Scalability: Can be scaled to include different types of skin cancer or integrated with larger diagnostic systems.
# Technologies Used
* Programming Language: Python
* Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow
* Image Processing: OpenCV
# Dataset
The system was trained on a Kagle  Dataset containing labeled images of different types of skin lesions. Pre-processing steps like resizing, normalization, and augmentation were applied to improve the model's performance.
# Model Architecture
The model employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, designed to extract important features from images, such as texture, shape, and color, which are critical for accurate classification.
# Results
The model achieved 90% accuracy on the validation dataset.
# Contributing
Contributions to improve the model or add features are welcome. Feel free to submit pull requests or open issues.
